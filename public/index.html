            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
            </p>
            <p class="htp_rp">
            Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.<br>Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
            </p>
            <p class="htp_rp">
            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
            </p>
            <p class="htp_rp">
            The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

        Protection through vaccination
      </h2>
      <p class="vac_rp">
        Vaccines strengthen your immune system by training it to quickly remember and fight specific germs.
      </p>
      <p class="vac_rp">
        Vaccination involves receiving a vaccine from a needle or drops in the mouth by a trained health professional.A COVID-19 vaccine will be from a needle.
      </p>
      <p class="vac_rp">
        After vaccination, if you do catch the disease, your illness is likely to be less severe.
      </p>
      <p class="vac_rp">
        Vaccines are a safe way to strengthen your immune system without causing illness.
      </p>
      <h2 class="vac_title">
        Likely side effects from COVID-19 vaccines
      </h2>
      <p class="vac_rp">
        All medicines, including vaccines, have risks and benefits. Usually, any side effects are mild and may only last a few days.
      </p>
      <p class="vac_rp">
        Some of the normal temporary side effects for COVID-19 vaccines include pain at the injection site, fever or muscle aches.
      </p>
      <p class="vac_rp">
        Some people will experience flu-like symptoms from the vaccine that are more significant when compared to other common vaccinations, and may need time away from normal activities. For the Pfizer (COMIRNATY) vaccine, these symptoms are more common after the second dose. For the AstraZeneca vaccine, these symptoms are more common after the first dose.
